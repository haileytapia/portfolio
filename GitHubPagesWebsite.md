## Create a GitHub repository

You need a GitHub account to create a repository. If you do not have a GitHub account, create one for free at [github.com](https://github.com).

To create a repository:

1.  In the upper-right corner of any GitHub page, select **+** > **New repository**.

    ![Select **+**, then select **New repository**.](https://github.com/haileytapia/portfolio/assets/78626762/223f955f-0c41-46f5-a467-e5abf9c4dd4d)

    The **Create a new repository** page opens.
2.  In the **Repository name** field, use the following format to name your repository: `<user>.github.io`
3.  Leave the repository as **Public** if you want your website to be accessible to anyone.  
    {:  .note }
    > Select **Private** if you want to restrict access to only selected individuals. This may require a paid GitHub subscription.
4.  Select **Initialize this repository with a README**.
5.  Select **Create repository**.
