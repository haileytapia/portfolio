# Contributions to the Splunk Style Guide
{: .no_toc }

As a Technical Writer Intern at Splunk, I created and revised various pieces of content for the [_Splunk Style Guide_](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/StyleGuide/current/StyleGuide/Howtouse), the writing style reference for Splunk documentation and products.

The table of contents below contains the sections of the _Splunk Style Guide_ to which I contributed. Select a link to open the section in a new page.
