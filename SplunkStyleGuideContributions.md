> As a Technical Writer Intern at Splunk, I created and revised various pieces of content for the _Splunk Style Guide_, the writing style reference for Splunk documentation and products.

The table of contents below contains the sections of the _Splunk Style Guide_ to which I contributed. Select a link to open the section in a new page.

## UI text guidelines

The following content, which I developed and reformatted, provides guidelines for writing user interface (UI) text at Splunk:

### [Terminal punctuation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/StyleGuide/current/StyleGuide/UIGuidelines#Terminal_punctuation)

Follow these best practices for terminal punctuation:

*   Use a period at the end of complete sentences.
*   When writing single, short, descriptive phrases that are not complete sentences, don't use a period at the end.
*   If a UI element requires more than one phrase of description, write them as sentences and use a period or other appropriate punctuation to distinguish them from one another and to enhance readability.
*   If a word or phrase is meant to be read as a question, use a question mark.
*   Don't use exclamation marks.
*   If a single view, page, or dialog box contains descriptive text that uses both full sentences and fragments, try rewriting the full sentences into fragments. If it isn't possible to rewrite the full sentences into fragments, use terminal punctuation for all of the text for consistency.

For more punctuation guidelines, see [Punctuation and symbols](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/StyleGuide/current/StyleGuide/Showingsymbolsintext).

See the following examples of correct and incorrect punctuation:

| Correct | Incorrect |
| --- | --- |

| Search results | Search results. |
| The search processed 100,000 events. This process took less than a minute. | The search processed 100,000 events, this process took less than a minute. |
