# Buy a Domo Listing

As a Technical Writer Intern at Domo, I created this article about purchasing one-time payment listings on their [BI platform](https://www.domo.com/business-intelligence), which provides data integration, visualization, and analysis tools.

## Introduction

In addition to free listings, the Appstore offers three types of paid listings:

*   **One-time payment:** This article describes how to [buy a listing](#buy-a-listing) with a one-time payment.
*   **Monthly subscription:** See [Manage Subscriptions to Domo Listings](/portfolio/ManageSubscriptionsDomoListings) for information.
*   **Quote:** When you request a quote, Domo reviews the request and contacts you with the next steps.

Payments for listings are processed through Stripe.

## Buy a listing

Follow these steps to buy a one-time payment listing:

1.  Select **Appstore** from the navigation header.
     
2.  In the side panel of the Appstore, select <img src="https://domo-support.domo.com/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka05w00000128HG&feoid=00N5w00000Ri7BU&refid=0EM5w000006uZz8" width="20"> **Search**.

    The **Search Apps** page opens.  
3.  Under the **Price** Quick Filter, select the **One time payment** checkbox. There are additional Quick Filters to sort the listings by component, category, publisher name, and data source.  
    All listings that require a one-time payment and match any other Quick Filters display.

    You are redirected to Stripe to complete the payment.  
6.  On the Stripe payment page, complete the **Card information**, **Name on card**, and **Country or region** fields. These fields are required to enable the **Pay** button.  

    {:  .note }
    >The **Email** field automatically populates with the email associated with your Domo account. 

7.  (Optional) Select the **Securely save my information for 1-click checkout** checkbox to reuse your payment information for future transactions. If you select this checkbox, you must also enter your phone number to enable the **Pay** button.  
8.  Select **Pay** to charge the one-time payment to your card.
