> Listings on the Domo Appstore extend the functionality of Domo, an ABI platform that provides tools for data integration, visualization, and analysis.

In addition to free listings, the Appstore offers the following types of paid listings:

*   **A one-time payment:** This article describes how to buy a listing with a one-time payment.
*   **A monthly subscription:** See [Manage subscriptions to listings](/portfolio/ManageSubscriptionsDomoListings) for information.
*   **A quote:** After you request a quote, Domo will process the request and contact you with next steps.
