## About me

I am pursuing a B.A. in English: Technical Communication at the University of Central Florida. Just as documentation revolves around the audience, so does my approach to writing and designâ€”something I hope this portfolio reflects!

I have interned as a Technical Writer for:

- Splunk's Security team
- Domo's Education team
- LSC Communications' Customer Experience department

See my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haileytapia/) for more of my professional experience, including technical support, an editorial internship, and technical writing for a military training manual.

In addition to my technical writing skills, I have experience with the following:

### Programming languages

- C
- Java

### Markup and styling languages

- Markdown
- HTML/CSS
- XML

### Tools and technologies

- Asana
- Confluence
- HubSpot
- Jira
- Salesforce
