## Contact me

I _could_ direct you to the top of this page for my contact information, but that wouldn't be very user friendly, would it? (Pretend the **Back to top** link below doesn't exist.)

Here, save yourself the journey to my [email](mailto:haileytapia@knights.ucf.edu) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haileytapia/).
