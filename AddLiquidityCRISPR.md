><span class="icon">&#9432;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;As an Editorial Intern at Berkeley Pharma Tech, I created this article about adding liquidity to the company's crypto token.

Berkeley Pharma Tech is using CRISPR technology to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, combat climate change, and save the planet for future generations. To further these efforts, our team has developed the CRISPR token, which allows individuals like you to join our push for net-zero emissions on a global scale.

After [purchasing the CRISPR token](link), consider adding liquidity to the CRISPR token pool by following the steps in this article:

## What is liquidity?

In cryptocurrency, liquidity refers to how easily a coin can be sold or exchanged for other coins. You can add liquidity to the CRISPR token by pairing CRISPR with another token or coin available on PancakeSwap, such as BNB.

Adding liquidity to our coin comes with a number of benefits. For example, you can:

- Earn a small percentage for every trade involving the CRISPR token
- Bet your LP tokens on the farm to earn a high APR (coming soon)
- Passively earn rewards through the Syrup Pools (coming soon)

## How to add liquidity 

Follow the steps below, starting with [Swap BNB for Smart Chain](#swap-bnb-for-smart-chain), to add liquidity to the CRISPR token.

### Swap BNB for BSC

Before adding liquidity to the platform, you must exchange your Binance Coin (BNB) for Binance Smart Chain (BSC) in your trust wallet. This step is necessary because PancakeSwap and other decentralized exchanges operate on the Binance Smart Chain network, which requires BSC for transactions.

> This article assumes that you have purchased CRISPR, so you should have a trust wallet. If not, see [Buy CRISPR](article) before proceeding with this article.

Follow these steps to swap your BNB for BSC:

1.  Open your trust wallet.
2.  In your list of tokens, locate and select **BNB**.

### Add liquidity

Once you have BSC in your trust wallet, you can add liquidity to the CRISPR token pool:

1.  In a browser, go to [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/).
2.  Select **Trade** \> **Liquidity**.  
    A page that contains your liquidity positions opens.
3.  Select **\+ Add Liquidity**.  
    The **Add** _**Current PancakeSwap Version**_ **Liquidity** page opens.
4.  Under **Choose Token Pair**, two input fields are separated by a **+** plus sign. Select the first input field to open the **Select a Token** modal.
5.  Choose **BNB** from the list of tokens.
6.  Select the second input field and choose **CRISPR Token** from the list of tokens. If CRISPR is not on the list, enter the following contract address in the **Search name or paste address** field: 0xaa3d6308d963f218a6df85f0a94faeacc4ed5ded  
    Note: If you enter CRISPR's contract address in the search field, the Import Tokens modal may appear and ask you to confirm that the token comes from an unknown source. Select the **I understand** checkbox, and then select **Import**.
7.  Under **Depost Amount**, enter your desired amount for either token. The other token’s field automatically populates.
8.  Select Supply.  
    The **You will receive** modal appears with the amount of BNB/CRISPR pool tokens to be received.
9.  To confirm the estimated output of your transaction, select **Confirm Supply**.
10.  Go to your trust wallet and select **Approve** in the transaction prompt.

Your Cake-LP balance now displays in your wallet.

### Import Cake-LP

After adding liquidity, you have to manually import your Cake-LP asset to your wallet:
