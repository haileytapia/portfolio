## Managing and Collaborating on Documents Using Google Docs

Google Docs is a cloud-based service that allows for easy access and collaboration from anywhere with an internet connection. Use Google Docs to manage and collaborate on style guide related tasks.

### File Naming Conventions

#### Individual Assignments

Use the following format to name individual assignments: _Last Name_ - _Assignment Name_

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Example:</strong>&nbsp;Smith - Research Discussion</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Group Assignments

Use the following format to name group assignments: _Group Number_ \- _Assignment Name_

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Example:</strong>&nbsp;Group 4 - Style Sheet</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Sharing Documents

1.  Open a document in Google Docs.
2.  Select **Share** in the upper-right corner.
3.  Under “General access,” select **Restricted**, and then choose **Anyone with the link** from the drop-down menu.
4.  To the right of “Anyone with the link,” select **Viewer**, and then choose **Editor** from the drop-down menu.
5.  Select **Copy link** and then **Done** to save the changes.
6.  Share the copied document link with your team members.

### Best Practices for Collaboration

To ensure smooth and effective collaboration with your group members, follow these best practices:

*   **Use Google Docs’ comment feature or suggestion mode to provide feedback.** Avoid making changes directly to the document, as this can cause version control issues.
*   **Respond to comments in a timely manner.** Check your document regularly for new activity.
*   **Keep track of changes.** If you make changes to the document, be sure to communicate those changes to your group members.
*   **Avoid deleting or moving content without consulting your group.** If you need to make major changes to the document, notify your group members beforehand.
*   **Communicate effectively.** Use clear, concise language when communicating with your group members and avoid using technical terms that may be unfamiliar to others.

Following these guidelines will help make your group collaboration experience smooth, effective, and productive.

## Basic Formatting and Styles

When working on your style guide chapter, follow the guidelines below to ensure that your chapter is properly formatted and styled in Google Docs.

### Font

Use Arial as the default font for all text in the document.

### Default Text Styles

Use the following built-in text styles for chapter titles, subsections, and body text. These are found in the **Styles** dropdown from the menu at the top.

![](https://33333.cdn.cke-cs.com/kSW7V9NHUXugvhoQeFaf/animations/255116095ab723e0db48f8e95cb0e2d5763c17473353a56e.gif)

*   **Heading 1** for main chapter titles.
*   **Heading 2** for subheadings within chapters, such as sections of a chapter.
*   **Heading 3** for subheadings within subheadings, if necessary.
*   **Heading 4** for any further subheadings, if necessary.
*   **Normal text** for body text.

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Heading sizes are nested; a heading 2 should only be used under a heading 1, a heading 3 should only be used under a heading 2, and so on.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Chapter Formatting and Writing

### Introduction

Begin each chapter with an introduction that includes the following:

*   A definition or brief explanation of the topic.
*   The role of the topic in technical communication.
*   An overview of the chapter contents.

Do not use “Introduction” or any other text as a heading. Simply introduce the section beneath the chapter title. For a sample chapter introduction, see below.

<table><tbody><tr><td><h2><strong>Chapter Title</strong></h2><p>This is a sample introduction to a team’s chapter. The topic of this chapter means so and so. It is an integral part of technical communication because it helps audiences achieve great things.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This chapter covers X, Y, and Z.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Conclusion

End each chapter with a conclusion that recapitulates its key points and leaves the reader with a call to action or final takeaway. Use “Conclusion” as the heading.

### Point of View

Write in the third person point of view. Do not address the reader directly with “you,” “your,” or “yourself.”

The pronouns used in the third person are as follows:

*   she, her, hers, herself
*   he, him, his, himself
*   they, them, themselves, their, theirs

## Additional Formatting Elements

### Page Formatting

#### Margins

Use 1-inch margins on all sides of the document.

#### Spacing

Use 1.15 spacing throughout the document.

To separate body paragraphs, press the **Enter** key twice on your keyboard to add a blank line between them. See below for an example.

<table><tbody><tr><td><p>This is sample text for a body paragraph in the style guide. I want to separate this paragraph from the paragraph that follows. To do this, I will press the&nbsp;<strong>Enter&nbsp;</strong>key twice instead of using any of the spacing options in Google Docs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is the paragraph I have separated.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

For bulleted and numbered lists, add a space after each item except the last by following these steps:

1.  Select any part of a list item.
2.  In the menu at the top, select **Line & paragraph spacing** > **Add space after list item**.
3.  Repeat for each list item except the last.

#### Page Numbers

Do not use page numbers in your chapter submissions. The technical editors will add these in the final stages of editing and compiling the style guide.

#### Headers and Footers 

Include a bold, right-aligned header with the chapter title on each page except the one that contains the chapter title. To apply these formatting elements to a header or footer, follow the steps below.

1.  In the menu at the top, select **Insert**.
2.  Choose **Headers & footers** > **Header**.
3.  Select the **Different first page** checkbox   
      
    ![](https://33333.cdn.cke-cs.com/kSW7V9NHUXugvhoQeFaf/images/edc55f3d1b326be960aaca1e03b7c8c83b52d308a5b739ad.png)  
     
4.  Scroll to the next page and double click anywhere in the header.
5.  Select ![](https://33333.cdn.cke-cs.com/kSW7V9NHUXugvhoQeFaf/images/18e0d7e24ed3547aee9d35ab22768ec14670f1fc8c139ef4.png) **Right align** to align the text to the right.
6.  Select ![](https://33333.cdn.cke-cs.com/kSW7V9NHUXugvhoQeFaf/images/aff6098f428bcee184c650faeaa8e9802fee068314d7b61d.png) **Bold** to bold the text.
7.  Enter the name of the chapter.

Do not use footers.

#### Page Breaks

Use page breaks to separate chapters in your document. To insert a page break in Google Docs, follow these steps:

1.  Place your mouse cursor where you want to insert the break.
2.  In the menu at the top, select **Insert**.
3.  Choose **Break** > **Page break**.

### Headings and Subheadings  

#### Capitalization

Use title case for all headings and subheadings. This means capitalizing the first word and all other words except articles, prepositions, and conjunctions that are three letters or less. For more information, see [Grammar and Punctuation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15q64Ki6b-51MB_ZH6b07z3myC_IUEK3btADp_hx1O3o/edit#heading=h.s2kl7pz3jjf7).

<table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Examples:</strong>&nbsp;A Style Guide for Technical Communicators</p><p>How to Apply Documentation Layout Principles</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Verb Form

Whenever possible, lead with the continuous (-ing) verb tense instead of other verb forms. Do not use the phrase "how to”; this can make the title seem less engaging or informative.

<table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Examples:</strong>&nbsp;Defining Accessibility in Technical Communication</p><p>Creating Visual Communication</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Text Alignment

There are four types of text alignment in Google Docs, as shown in the following table:

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Alignment Type</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td><td><strong>Example</strong></td><td><strong>When to Use</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Left</td><td>This alignment aligns text to the left margin.</td><td>This is left-aligned text.</td><td>Use for headings, subheadings, and body text.</td></tr><tr><td>Right</td><td>This alignment aligns text to the right margin.</td><td>This is right-aligned text.</td><td>Use for headers.</td></tr><tr><td>Centered</td><td>This alignment aligns text to the center of the page.</td><td>This text is centered.</td><td>Use for images, tables and table headings, figures, and captions.</td></tr><tr><td>Justified</td><td>This alignment adds space between words so that both edges of each line align with both margins.</td><td>This text is justified.</td><td>Do not use.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Colors

Use only black for text throughout the document. Exceptions include images, charts, or other visual aids where color can help convey meaning or distinguish between data points.

### Bold, Italics, Highlighting, and Other Textual Emphasis

*   Use **bold** text only in tables or note/example boxes.
*   Use _italics_ to indicate a name or title.
*   Do not highlight text under any circumstances. 
*   Use underline only for hyperlinked text.

### Quotes

#### Single Quotes

Use single quotes to quote either text that contains only a few words or quotations within quotations. For more information, see [Grammar and Punctuation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15q64Ki6b-51MB_ZH6b07z3myC_IUEK3btADp_hx1O3o/edit#heading=h.s2kl7pz3jjf7).

When using single quotes, enclose the text in single quotation marks (‘).

<table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Examples:</strong>&nbsp;‘text’</p><p>Dr. Campbell said, “A student asked me, ‘Why is technical communication important?’ I had many answers.”</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Double Quotes

Use double quotes for direct quotations. For more information, see [Grammar and Punctuation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15q64Ki6b-51MB_ZH6b07z3myC_IUEK3btADp_hx1O3o/edit#heading=h.s2kl7pz3jjf7). 

When using double quotes, enclose the text in double quotation marks (“).

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Example:</strong>&nbsp;According to Dr. Campbell, "Technical communication is important."&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Block Quotes

Use block quotes for quotes longer than three lines. Do not use quotation marks or reformat the quote in any way except as described above.

To create a block quote, follow these steps:

1.  Select the text you want to use as a block quote.
2.  In the menu at the top, select ![](https://33333.cdn.cke-cs.com/kSW7V9NHUXugvhoQeFaf/images/7f9b30cfda9550747e4faaa972aa9a31a91928bf001599e0.png) **Increase indent**.
3.  In the same menu at the top, select ![](https://33333.cdn.cke-cs.com/kSW7V9NHUXugvhoQeFaf/images/d8cd273ffb31299cdf2f00204085d0fb575a08acfbf32d5b.png) **Line & paragraph spacing**, then choose **Double**.
4.  Drag the blue right margin indicator to the 6-inch mark.

### Lists

Bullets and numbering are effective tools for organizing lists and highlighting important information. Use indentation, also known as levels, to show hierarchy in lists.

For steps on how to space bulleted and numbered lists, see [this section of the style sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15q64Ki6b-51MB_ZH6b07z3myC_IUEK3btADp_hx1O3o/edit#bookmark=id.dl4cz96xsjam).

#### Bulleted Lists

*   Use bullets for unordered lists.
*   These are lists where the order of information does not matter.
    *   If you rearrange the items, the list's meaning does not change.

#### Numbered Lists

1.  Use numbering for ordered lists.
2.  These are lists where the order of information does not matter.
    1.  If you rearrange the items, the list's meaning changes.

When using numbered lists, follow a logical sequence and avoid using more than two levels of numbering.

### Images

Every image must have a dark gray border, be 1pt thick, and be centered on your document’s page. To format an image in this way, follow these steps:

1.  Insert an image into the document.
2.  Select the image, then select ![](https://33333.cdn.cke-cs.com/kSW7V9NHUXugvhoQeFaf/images/e051cd4f0bf45186a549e546b5d947e868557d6801b0f916.png) **Border color** from the menu at the top.
3.  Choose **Dark gray 1**.
4.  Select the image again, then select ![](https://33333.cdn.cke-cs.com/kSW7V9NHUXugvhoQeFaf/images/d288e18c19521e16e2df7e9e0665cb90e5df2ec6ec0b4738.png) **Border weight**.
5.  Choose **1pt**.
6.  Select ![](https://33333.cdn.cke-cs.com/kSW7V9NHUXugvhoQeFaf/images/3d617de35ef26d06190e55697451ceced56c89ceb1102928.png) **Center align** from the menu at the top to center the image on the page.

### Captions

Use captions to provide context and explanation for images, tables, and figures. Center them below the item to which they refer. For more information, see [Guidelines for Image Captions and Figure Titles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15q64Ki6b-51MB_ZH6b07z3myC_IUEK3btADp_hx1O3o/edit#heading=h.uwdw1ulaljtr).

### Links

Use hyperlinks to direct users to external resources, such as websites. Ensure links are active and relevant before including them in your document.

Underline hyperlink text and color it blue. Do not underline non-hyperlinked text.

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Example:</strong>&nbsp;To learn more about formatting text in instructions, see&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/procedures-instructions/formatting-text-in-instructions">this article from Microsoft</a>.&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>

To insert a link, follow these steps:

1.  Place your cursor where you want the link, or highlight the text that you want to link.
2.  In the menu at the top, select **Insert** \> **Link.**
3.  In the **Search or paste a link field**, enter a URL or email address.
4.  Select **Apply**.

### Table Formatting

Our style guide requires a specific look for tables. They must have a certain cell padding with a thin, dark gray border and a light gray background.

To create a table with these formatting properties, follow these steps:

1.  Place your cursor where you want to insert the table.
2.  In the menu at the top, select **Insert** \> **Table**.
3.  In the grid that appears, select as many of the squares that are highlighted in blue as you want to have cells in the table.  
    A corresponding table is inserted into your document at the cursor location.
4.  Right-click the table, then select **Table properties**.
5.  Locate the Alignment section, and next to “Cell padding,” enter **0.1**.
6.  Locate the Color section.
7.  Under “Table border,” choose **Dark gray 1** for the color and **0.5pt** for the thickness.
8.  Under “Cell background color,” choose **Light gray 3**.

For example, a 2x3 table with a centered heading is formatted as shown below.

<table><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Sample Table</strong></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Note and Example Boxes

Note boxes draw attention to important information, while example boxes illustrate points. Use both to enhance the reader's understanding of the content.

You can follow the steps in the [Table Formatting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15q64Ki6b-51MB_ZH6b07z3myC_IUEK3btADp_hx1O3o/edit#bookmark=id.2jjb12qx6u5a) section above—but create a 1x1 table, not a custom one—or copy and paste the preformatted box below.

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Note/Example: </strong>Use this for a note or example box.</td></tr></tbody></table>
