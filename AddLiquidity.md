## What is liquidity?

In cryptocurrency, liquidity refers to how easily a coin can be sold or exchanged for other coins. You can add liquidity for the CRISPR token by pairing CRISPR with another token or coin available on PancakeSwap, like BNB. Adding liquidity for our coin comes with a number of incentives:
