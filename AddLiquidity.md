Berkeley Pharma Tech is using CRISPR technology to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, combat climate change, and save the planet for future generations. To further these efforts, our team has developed the CRISPR token, which allows individuals like you to join our push for net-zero emissions on a global scale.

After [purchasing the CRISPR token](link), consider adding liquidity to the token pool by following the steps in this article:

## What is liquidity?

In cryptocurrency, liquidity refers to how easily a coin can be sold or exchanged for other coins. You can add liquidity to the CRISPR token by pairing CRISPR with another token or coin available on PancakeSwap, such as BNB.

Adding liquidity to our coin comes with a number of benefits. For example, you can:

- Earn a small percentage for every trade involving the CRISPR token
- Bet your LP tokens on the farm to earn a high APR (coming soon)
- Passively earn rewards through the Syrup Pools (coming soon)

## How to add liquidity 

Adding liquidity is a three-step process, as outlined below. Follow the steps in sequential order to successfully add liquidity to the CRISPR token.

### Swap BNB for Smart Chain

Before adding liquidity to the platform, you must exchange your Binance Coin (BNB) for Binance Smart Chain (BSC) in your trust wallet. This step is necessary because PancakeSwap and other decentralized exchanges operate on the Binance Smart Chain network, which requires BSC for transactions.

Follow these steps to swap your BNB for BSC:

1.  Open your trust wallet.
