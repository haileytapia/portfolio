## User interface

There are three main components of Discord's interface:

- Servers
- Channels
- Direct messages

### Servers

When you first log in to Discord, you are taken to your server list. Servers are like chat rooms where you can join communities of like-minded individuals to chat and share ideas.

These are the communities you can join or create to connect with other users.

#### Join a server

To join a server, select **Join a Server** and enter the server's invite code. Once you're in a server, you see a list of its [channels](#channels) on the left-hand side.

#### Create a server

### Channels

Within servers, you can create or join channels to communicate with other users. Each server can have multiple channels, and each channel can have its own topic. 

#### Join a channel

To join a channel, select its name in the server list.

#### Create a channel

### Direct messages

Direct messages, or DMs, are private conversations between you and another user outside of servers. 

#### Create a direct message

Start a DM with someone by selecting their name in your Friends list and selecting Message. Once you've started a DM, you can chat, share files, and even make voice and video calls.
