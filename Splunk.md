# Splunk

I created the following content for Splunk Mission Control, a cloud-based security operations console that unifies threat detection, investigation, and response:

- [Create an intelligence workflow to enrich data](/portfolio/TIMEnrichData)
- [Create an intelligence workflow to reduce false positives](/portfolio/TIMFalsePositives)
- [Investigate an incident](/portfolio/InvestigateIncidents)

I also created the following content for the [Splunk Style Guide](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/StyleGuide/current/StyleGuide/Howtouse), which outlines how to write Splunk documentation and write about Splunk products:

- [Using numbers in text](/portfolio/Numbers)
- [Usage Dictionary entries](/portfolio/UsageDictionaryEntries)
- [Terminal punctuation in UI text](/portfolio/TerminalPunctuation)
