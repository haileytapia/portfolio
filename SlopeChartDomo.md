> Charts in Domo, an ABI platform, are visual representations of data that help users understand and analyze information more easily.

A slope chart visualizes data from a given time period based on the period's start and end points. By simplifying the data into lines, this chart type allows you to focus on relevant information rather than the clutter of intermediate data points.

The following image shows a typical slope chart:

## Power slope charts

A slope chart requires a `date` field and a `value` field. You then select the start and end points from a variety of predefined options. The chart can also include other dimensions for multiple lines per dimension.

For information about value, category, and series data, see our article about [Understanding Chart Data](https://domo-support.domo.com/s/article/360043428693?language=en_US).

In Analyzer, you can choose the columns containing the data for your circular Sankey chart. For more information about choosing data columns, see our article about [Applying DataSet Columns to Your Chart](https://domo-support.domo.com/s/article/360043428713?language=en_US).

The following image shows how data from a typical column-based spreadsheet is converted into a slope chart:

## Customize slope charts

You can customize the appearance of a slope chart in several ways, many of which are possible with the **Chart Properties** tool. For more information, see our [Chart Properties](https://domo-support.domo.com/s/article/360042925374?language=en_US) article.
