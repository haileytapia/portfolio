## Intro
{: .no_toc }

Just as you use the find-and-replace tool to fix text in a document, scientists use gene editing to rewrite DNA sequences in living cells. CRISPR-Cas9 is particularly useful for gene editing because it is more precise, flexible, and efficient than traditional editing  methods.

This article discusses how CRISPR is transforming plant and crop engineering in the following topics:

## Plant gene editing

Traditional plant breeding has significant drawbacks, including its reliance on existing genes, which can be time-consuming and inefficient. Gene editing technologies, such as TALENs, ZFNs, and CRISPR-Cas9, provide more precise and specific methods for diversifying genes. These techniques have been used to genetically modify several crops for resistance to powdery mildew, herbicides, and biotic and abiotic stresses, resulting in increased size, yield, and quality. Gene editing can also be used to modify plants to produce extra proteins needed by diabetics or people with albumin deficiency.

## CRISPR’s role in genetically modifying plants

In recent years, CRISPR has emerged as a trailblazer among first-generation genome editing systems. It is simpler — not to mention more flexible, precise, cost-effective, and efficient — by comparison and is revolutionizing plant gene modification in various ways: it does not need foreign DNA unlike traditional genetic engineering; it has rapidly increased in use compared to other new plant breeding techniques; it has a broader range of applications, having been engineered in 45 plant genera across 24 families since its first success in 2013; and it can improve an array of agricultural traits, like yield and grain quality, plant architecture, and plant aesthetics. Of particular note is CRISPR’s power to enhance herbicide, disease, and drought resistance in crops. It goes without saying that CRISPR is ideal for genetic modification of plants, specifically trees.

_DNA and gene editing techniques using CRISPR technology_

Trees, as all plants do, naturally store carbon dioxide through a process called photosynthesis. In doing so, some CO2 is removed from the atmosphere, but not enough to significantly decrease atmospheric carbon levels. Our world so desperately needs the right species of trees with the right characteristics to lead carbon removal. Fortunately, CRISPR-engineered redwood trees offer the solution.

Scientists can improve photosynthesis and other biological processes to make trees strong carbon capture agents. Trees draw in sunlight (as well as CO2 and water) during photosynthesis; however, their intake is not as great as it could be. While the maximum efficiency of photosynthesis is theorized at about 12%, most plants absorb only 1–2% of the light that lands on them. Not all trees hold the same amount of carbon, either, so a tree with high carbon storage is necessary. Redwood trees fit the bill: they absorb up to 981 U.S. tons per acre, more carbon per acre than any other forest type on Earth.

Furthermore, trees can afford more tolerance to drought, cold weather, and other adverse conditions. But how? Enter genome editing, the answer to refining photosynthetic efficiency and increasing trees’ carbon absorption capacities. Genetically editing redwood trees will make them the perfect allies in the battle against climate change, and CRISPR is just the tool for the job.

## Where Berkeley Pharma Tech stands

Today, gene editing in plants using CRISPR largely focuses on improving food production and accelerating sustainable agricultural practices. Berkeley Pharma Tech’s efforts are similar but different in that we are trying to fight climate change. Crops are not our primary focus; instead, we center our work on redwood trees, genetically modifying them to optimize their carbon sequestration and lower CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. And attaining the promise of Net-Zero emissions is possible through our CRISPR token, which goes toward funding the carbon capture project and building a greener, more sustainable world for everyone.

## Hope for a better tomorrow

Scientists are making immeasurable progress in the dynamic field of genome editing, and this is only the beginning. As new attributes are introduced to plants to make them better, new pathways to agricultural and environmental breakthroughs are also forged. We bear witness to the genome editing techniques that can revolutionize agricultural biotechnology as we know it. CRISPR technology, in particular, promises a bright future for gene editing and its applications, and its value has not gone unnoticed by our team at Berkeley Pharma Tech. Together, we can combat global warming one tree at a time.
