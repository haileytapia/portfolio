> During my internship, Splunk changed its documentation style to use numerals instead of words for most numbers. I wrote the following guidance for the new style.

## Using numerals

In general, use numerals for numbers in text, even for numbers less than 10. This includes numbers associated with counts, dates, decimals, fractions, measurements, percentages, ranges, time, versions, weight, and other data for comparison or analysis.

### Don't start a sentence with a numeral

Avoid starting a sentence with a numeral. Instead, rewrite the sentence so the number comes later in the sentence or is prefaced by a modifier. If you can't rewrite the sentence, spell out the number at the beginning of the sentence.

Review the following table for examples of sentences that have been rewritten to follow these guidelines:

| Original sentence | Rewritten sentence |
| --- | --- |
| 4 peers are contained in this cluster. | This cluster contains 4 peers. |
| 11 hosts have unusually high CPU usage. | Eleven hosts have unusually high CPU usage. |

## When to spell out numbers

Numbers sometimes provide context or additional information without being the focus of the sentence. In such cases, spell out the number to emphasize what the number is describing rather than the number's numerical value.

Spell out ordinal numbers in text.

See the following examples:

*   Four types of lookups
*   Twelfth line in the code
*   Third-party software

## Hyphenating numbers

Hyphenate both numerals and spelled-out numbers when they are part of a compound adjective. See the following examples:

*   Two-factor authentication
*   128-bit number

## Examples of number usage

Review the following table for examples of correctly using numerals and spelling out numbers in text:

| Correct usage | Incorrect usage |
| --- | --- |
| Zero downtime | 0 downtime |
| Default value of 0 | Default value of zero |
| Follow these steps to move an app from one instance to another. | Follow these steps to move an app from 1 instance to another. |
| There are two kinds of field extractions. | There are 2 kinds of field extractions. |
| 1-, 2-, or 3-hour alerting intervals | One-, two-, or three-hour alerting intervals |
