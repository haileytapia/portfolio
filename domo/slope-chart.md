Slope charts visualize data from a given time period based on the period's start and end points. By simplifying the data into lines, this chart type allows you to focus on relevant information rather than the clutter of intermediate data points.

The following image shows a typical slope chart:

## Power slope charts

To power a slope chart, specify a `Date` field and a `Value` field, then select the start and end points from predefined options. You can also include multiple lines per dimension. See [Understanding chart data](https://domo-support.domo.com/s/article/360043428693?language=en_US) for more information about value, category, and series data.

In Analyzer, you can choose the columns that contain the data for your slope chart. See [Applying dataset columns to your chart](https://domo-support.domo.com/s/article/360043428713?language=en_US) for more information.

The following image shows data from a typical column-based spreadsheet as a slope chart:
