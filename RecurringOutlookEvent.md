Recurring events are events that occur on a regular basis, such as daily standups or weekly one-on-one meetings. You can use the calendar and scheduling component of [Outlook on the web](https://outlook.live.com/owa/) to create recurring events.

To create a recurring event:

1.  Select <img src="https://github.com/haileytapia/portfolio/assets/78626762/408b742a-1cde-49a1-a5a1-1f5b2786905f" width="15"> **Calendar** from the navigation menu.

    ![Calendar](https://github.com/haileytapia/portfolio/assets/78626762/8fa65fea-68fe-4ae4-b1a2-e627f0eb9308)
2.  Select **New event**.  
      
    ![New event](https://github.com/haileytapia/portfolio/assets/78626762/3cbe775b-47a2-4986-995f-0845fcaf24ec)

    The **New event** modal appears and prompts you for the event details.  
      
    ![New event modal](https://github.com/haileytapia/portfolio/assets/78626762/43e2f8a0-5774-4e43-931d-9931fb3c6166)  
3.  Enter the event title, attendees, start time, end time, and other details in the appropriate fields.
4.  <a id="step-four"></a>Select <img src="https://github.com/haileytapia/portfolio/assets/78626762/71cd859b-98ed-4fbb-85aa-2485ae6cd02e" width="20"> **Don’t repeat**, then select how often you want the event to occur: **Daily**, **Weekly**, **Monthly**, **Yearly**, or a **Custom** frequency.

    The **Repeat** modal appears. 

    ![Repeat modal](https://github.com/haileytapia/portfolio/assets/78626762/cadff286-4f88-41cf-99f7-eb3091c343c7)
5.  In the **Start** field, enter the date on which the event should begin.

6.  (Conditional) Follow the steps for the event frequency you selected in [step four](#step-four):

    <table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Event frequency</strong></td><td><strong>Steps</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Daily</td><td>Select the number of days between occurrences and the day(s) of the week the event occurs.</td></tr><tr><td>Weekly</td><td>​Select the number of weeks between occurrences and the day(s) of the week the event occurs.</td></tr><tr><td>Monthly</td><td>Select the number of months between occurrences and whether the meeting occurs on the same day each month or on the first day of the start date (for example, the first Friday) each month.</td></tr><tr><td>Yearly</td><td>Select the number of years between occurrences and whether the meeting occurs on the same date each year or on the first day of the start date (for example, the first Friday of April) each year.</td></tr><tr><td>Custom</td><td>Select custom options based on the frequency type. See the other rows in this table for more information.</td></tr></tbody></table>

7.  Select the end date for the event, then select **Save**.  

    Outlook saves the recurrence settings and returns you to the **New event** modal.
8. When you are ready to create your event, select **Save** (if you have not added attendees) or **Send** (if you have added attendees).

   ![Save](https://github.com/haileytapia/portfolio/assets/78626762/d6df9be4-cb95-4c28-a642-7c584d4d9ab2)

   ![Send](https://github.com/haileytapia/portfolio/assets/78626762/60381add-7bb5-40e6-bc20-1d6f629bf924)

Outlook creates your recurring event and displays all of its occurrences on your calendar.
